# Modeling and Simulation of Drug Dosing Strategy

## Description

This project focuses on the **modeling and simulation of drug dosing strategies**, with a special emphasis on antibiotics. Using PK/PD (Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics) models, the work establishes the optimal therapeutic dose of a drug administered to a patient.

### Main Features:
1. **PK/PD Models**:
   - One-compartment model.
   - Two-compartment model.
   - Three-compartment model.
2. **Patient Parameter Customization**:
   - Physiological parameters: sex, weight, age.
   - Biological parameters: serum creatinine, renal elimination rate.
3. **Dynamic Simulation**:
   - Simulates the evolution of the drug concentration and its effect on CFU (colony-forming units) over a 14-day period.
   - Selects the optimal dose for drug administration.
4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
   - Developed using **AppDesigner** in Matlab.
   - Allows input and adjustment of model parameters and visualization of simulation results in an accessible way.

## Objective

The project aims to facilitate the **optimal and safe administration of antibiotics** for patients, considering their biological and physiological parameters. The user can select the type of PK/PD model and view simulation results for multiple patients.

---

## Tools Used

- **SimBiology** in Matlab for creating and running PK/PD models.
- **AppDesigner** in Matlab for developing a user-friendly graphical interface.

## How Does It Work?

1. **Input Parameters**:
   - The user enters patient data (physiological and biological) in the graphical interface.
2. **Select PK/PD Model**:
   - Choose the desired pharmacokinetic model.
3. **Run Simulations**:
   - The system simulates dose dynamics over a 14-day period.
4. **Analyze Results**:
   - The user views graphs and recommendations for the optimal dose.
